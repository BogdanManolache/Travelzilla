# Overview

This is a NextJS project which is intended to provide the user a way to search for cities to visit and to be able to save the returned information into a database so that it can be viewed later.

### Built with:

Next.js
MongoDB with Mongoose
Leaflet
Tailwind CSS
React Icons
React World Flags

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm install
&
npm run dev
```

If you want to run the app on your local machine make sure to add your own MongoDB URI in the "./db/mongodb.js" file or to create a .env file where you can save your MongoDb URI in a variable called "MONGO_URI".

## IMPORTANT

There are separate branches in this repo corresponding to each stage of the project's development.
